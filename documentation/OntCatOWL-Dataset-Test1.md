# Test 1 Files

# Description

This document describes the structure of the files generated by the execution of OntCatOWL Test 1. Each section below regards a different type of file. For a complete description of Test 1, please access this link **(link to be created)**.

Test 1 was executed in both complete and incomplete OntCatOWL modes (more information in this link **(link to be created)**), generating the content presented in two folders inside each one of the catalog's datasets: _test\_1\_ac_ and _test\_1\_an_, respectively. These folders contain the same type of documents here described, but with the different content that resulted from the different execution modes.

# Execution Summary Files (execution\_summary\_N.csv)

The execution summary registers the input class and its classification used in each one of the OntCatOWL executions performed on the model's taxonomies.

A file entitled `execution_summary_N.csv` is generated for each model and it aggregates information about all the OntCatOWL executions on the same taxonomy. The number N corresponds to the taxonomy number (e.g., the file _execution\_summary\_01.csv_ inside a dataset's folder corresponds to the taxonomy file _taxonomy\_01.ttl_). The items registered in the _csv_ files are:

- execution\_number: is the first column of the _csv_ file. Registers the number of the execution of the test in which the next fields were measured or calculated
- input\_class\_name: name of the model's class used as input for performing the execution of OntCatOWL
- input\_class\_stereotype: "stereotype" of input class. This information is, in fact, a gUFO classification got via a mapping from the original OntoUML stereotype of the class. More information can be found here **(link to be created)**

# Execution Statistics Files (execution\_statistics\_N.csv)

This file registers statistics related to numbers and percentages of classes, classifications, and other information got from the software execution.

For an easier presentation, we are going to classify the data presented in this file into three groups: classes, classifications, and others. Note that the order of the items being described does not correspond to the same order they occur in the _csv_ file.

A single file entitled `execution_statistics_N.csv` is generated for each model's independent taxonomical graph and it aggregates information about all its OntCatOWL executions. The number N corresponds to the taxonomy number (e.g., the file _execution\_statistics\_01.csv_ inside a dataset's folder corresponds to the taxonomy file _taxonomy\_01.ttl_).

## Classes

Classes items always have the term "classes\_". The different measured or calculated aspects are:

- Measuring moments: before (\_b), after (\_a), and difference (prefix diff and suffix \_d) between the measuring moments
- Knowledge about a class classification: totally unknown (\_tu), partially known (\_pk), totally known (\_tk)
- Data format: measured values (suffix \_v) (i.e., units), and percentages (suffix \_p)

## Classifications

Classifications are the gUFO classes (e.g., Kind, Sortal, RigidType) in which an OWL ontology concept can be mapped to (for endurant types, via a rdf:type predicate). Considering only Endurant Types, the possible classifications of a class are: `gufo:AntiRigidType`, `gufo:Category`, `gufo:Kind`, `gufo:Mixin`, `gufo:NonRigidType`, `gufo:NonSortal`, `gufo:Phase`, `gufo:PhaseMixin`, `gufo:RigidType`, `gufo:Role`, `gufo:RoleMixin`, `gufo:SemiRigidType`, `gufo:Sortal`, `gufo:SubKind`.

Classifications items always have the term "classif\_". The different measured or calculated aspects are:

- Measuring moments: before ("\_b"), after ("\_a"), and difference (prefix "diff\_" and suffix "\_d") between the measuring moments
- Knowledge about classifications: total number, known, and unknown classifications. The total number is the sum of known and unknown classifications
- Data format: measured values (suffix "\_v") (i.e., units), and percentages (suffix "\_p")

### List of Items

- `classif_b_total_classif_types_v`: total number of classifications available for all the classes in the file taxonomy.ttl used in the software before the execution of OntCatOWL rules. The total number of classifications is the number of classifications available for a single class multiplied by the number of classes in the model. As no classification is included or excluded during the execution of the software, classif\_b\_total\_classif\_types\_v = classif\_a\_total\_classif\_types\_v. Also, classif\_b\_total\_classif\_types\_v = classif\_b\_unknown\_classif\_types\_v + classif\_b\_known\_classif\_types\_v.
- `classif_b_unknown_classif_types_v`: is the sum of all unknown classifications of all classes before the execution of OntCatOWL rules

## Other Items

Besides information about classes and their classifications, the _csv_ file also presents two additional fields:

- `execution`: is the first column of the _csv_ file. Registers the number of the execution of the test in which the next fields were measured or calculated
- `incomplete_classes_found`: is the last column of the _csv_ file. Registers how many incomplete classes OntCatOWL identified during the execution

# Execution Times Files (execution\_times\_N.csv)

This file registers the time (in seconds) that each individual rule took for being performed and the execution total time.

A single file entitled `execution_times_N.csv` is generated for each model's independent taxonomical graph and it aggregates information about all its OntCatOWL executions. The number N corresponds to the taxonomy number (e.g., the file execution\_times\_01.csv inside a dataset's folder corresponds to the taxonomy file taxonomy\_01.ttl).

The items registered in the _csv_ files are:

- `execution`: is the first column of the _csv_ file. Registers the number of the execution of the test in which the next fields were measured or calculated
- `k_s_sup`: execution time (in seconds) for the specific OntCatOWL rule of the same name
- `s_k_sub`: execution time (in seconds) for the specific OntCatOWL rule of the same name
- `t_k_sup`: execution time (in seconds) for the specific OntCatOWL rule of the same name

# Inconsistencies CSV File (inconsistencies\_found\_N.csv)

Considering an incomplete model as complete may cause inconsistencies—and the catalog models used for this test don't explicitly state if they intend to represent complete or incomplete information. Hence, the execution of Test 1 AC resulted in the detection of inconsistencies in some models. Inconsistencies may also occur when an OntoUML model is syntactically invalid. However, Test 1 cannot detect this situation as it only uses a single class as input.

We reported all inconsistencies found in the file ` inconsistencies_found_N.csv`, where each item is a dataset with a list of the classes used as input in the executions where the inconsistencies were found. The number N corresponds to the taxonomy number (e.g., the file inconsistencies\_found\_01.csv inside a dataset's folder corresponds to the taxonomy file taxonomy\_01.ttl).

The _csv_ file contains the following columns:

- `execution_number`: is the first column of the _csv_ file. Registers the number of the execution of the test in which the inconsistency was detected
- `inconsistent_class_name`: the model's class used as input on the test in which the inconsistency was detected
- `inconsistent_class_stereotype`: the input class's gUFO classification (i.e., its OntoUML stereotype mapped to a gUFO endurant type)

The OntCatOWL-Tester creates this file only in datasets that Test 1 AC detected inconsistencies during the executions. When OntCatOWL detects an inconsistency, it interrupts the current test's execution, and it starts the next one.

# Results YAML Files

Differently from the other files already presented, Test 1 generates the _csv_ and _yaml_ results files for each of its executions (i.e., the number of these files is going to be the same number of classes that the tested model has). The Tester stores these files in the `results` folder inside the catalog's dataset folder.

This _yaml_ file contains the complete output of the execution of the OntCatOWL. It presents the results of all evaluated classes, displaying their following information in a dictionary format:

- `input`: a Boolean value that indicates if the class was used as an input for the execution of the test
- `is_type`: a list of all gUFO classifications asserted to the class
- `can_type`: a list of all gUFO classifications that a class _can_ assume (i.e., it is not possible to assume that the class can be classified according to an item on the list and also there are no known restrictions against its classification
- `not_type`: a list of all gUFO classifications that the class cannot assume
- `is_incomplete`: a Boolean value that indicates if OntCatOWL detected the class as incomplete or not
- `detected_in`: a list containing all rules that detected the incompleteness of the class. If the value of is\_incomplete is False, then this list must be empty

`classes_test1_ac_exM_txN.yaml`. The number M corresponds to the execution number and the number N corresponds to the taxonomy number (e.g., the file classes\_test1\_ac\_exM\_txN.yaml inside a dataset's folder corresponds to the first execution for the taxonomy file taxonomy\_01.ttl).

# Results CSV Files

As occurs with the results _yaml_ files, Test 1 generates the _csv_ results files for each of its executions (i.e., the number of these files is going to be the same number of classes that the tested model has). The Tester stores these files in the `results` folder inside the catalog's dataset folder.

This file contains a simplified view of the results presented in the _yaml_ file with the objective of simplifying queries for evaluating possible inconsistencies. If any class has the value "not" in its _classification\_final\_list_ field, then the model is inconsistent. Valid values are "can" when the classification is unknown, or "is", for known classifications.

- `class_name`: name of the class being evaluated
- `class_original_classification`: original gUFO classification of the class, obtained from its OntoUML stereotype
- `classification_final_list`: list where the class's original gUFO classification is located after the OntCatOWL execution

`results_test1_ac_exM_txN.csv`. The number M corresponds to the execution number and the number N corresponds to the taxonomy number (e.g., the file results\_test1\_ac\_ex01\_tx01.csv inside a dataset's folder corresponds to the first execution for the taxonomy file taxonomy\_01.ttl).
